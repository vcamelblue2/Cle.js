# CLE
 Welcome to Clean / Clever JS (T.B.D). 
 
 Originally launched with the technical name of "Caged Lazy Elements" as evolution of LE, is a declarative Javascript Framework, with pure POJO in mind (for doom/ui, logic & css/style), a "caged" environment, a TRUE reactive nature and "static" analysis (used to build dependencies between componentes).
 
 Inspired by: 
  - QML (ID & Naming, true "reactive" properties, signals & slot)
  - Angular (ng-for, ng-if, "auto-update")
  - React (light & dynamic, with very limited size & memory footprint)
  - and many more
